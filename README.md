# blogList-backend
This is the backend of a fullstack application that let's you login (if you created a user) and save blogs that may interest you. 
It is build with Node/Express and MongoDB as the database.

## TO MAKE IT WORK: 
1. Fork the repo, install all dependecies and create a new cluster in MongoDB Atlas. 
2. You will have to populate the .env file with four env variables:
### MONGO_URI  = yourclusterURI (EXAMPLE: mongodb+srv://yourusername:ToJjVxIiBcxS9Fg7@cluste0.xgnsz3c.mongodb.net/blogList?retryWrites=true&w=majority)
### TEST_MONGO_URI = yourcluster(EXAMPLE: mongodb+srv://giovanipaolonii:ToJjVxIiBcxS9Fg7@cluste0.xgnsz3c.mongodb.net/testBlogList?retryWrites=true&w=majority)                                                           
### PORT = 3003 (the app listen that port by default)
### SECRET = anystring (This is for JasonWebToken so you can use any string that u want.)
                                                                  
3. After setting this things, run in the console `npm start` to lift the server or `npm run dev` to start it with nodemon in development mode.

That's it! Put the frontend to work and start saving, liking or deleting your blogs!ðŸ˜„
